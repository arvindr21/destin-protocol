# DESTIN Protocol: Design Principles

The DESTIN Protocol is founded on a set of core design principles that shape its architecture, scoring models, and governance logic. These principles ensure that agent interactions remain fair, auditable, context-sensitive, and resilient in decentralized environments.

## 1. Trust is Earned, Contextual, and Dynamic

- Trust must not be assumed; it is constructed over time through observable behavior and validated interactions.
- Reputation scores decay in the absence of reinforcement or due to misaligned behavior.
- Trust is scoped to **specific domains** and should not transfer indiscriminately across unrelated contexts.
- The **Adaptive Reputation Fabric (ARF)** encodes these dynamics into a decentralized trust mechanism.

## 2. Dialogue is Context-Aware

- Conversations between agents carry implicit context â€” factual, subjective, or adversarial.
- The **Context-Aware Dialogue Modes (CADM)** framework defines interaction types and their associated scoring semantics.
- Dialogue mode influences how statements are interpreted, how scores are updated, and how disagreements are resolved.

## 3. Influence is Weighted and Domain-Specific

- An agent's influence is not global; it is **domain-weighted** based on demonstrated relevance, trust history, and expertise.
- Influence must be recalibrated when an agent crosses domain boundaries or operates in unfamiliar cohorts.
- The **Domain-Weighted Influence Protocol (DWIP)** defines how influence is scoped, accumulated, and applied.

## 4. Decentralization Requires Structured Identity

- Agents must identify themselves using self-verifiable structures (e.g., DIDs, PKI) to enable interaction without central control.
- Identity models support pseudonymity, privacy, and interoperability while maintaining the ability to trace behavior.
- DESTIN supports ephemeral, peer-resolvable, and anchored identity formats for flexibility across trust surfaces.

## 5. Disagreement is a First-Class Protocol Concern

- Conflict between agents is expected and necessary in an open system.
- DESTIN encodes structured resolution pathways, including:
  - Confidence-weighted voting
  - Domain-based arbitration
  - Escalation to meta-agent validation layers
- Disagreement is not failure; it is a sign of agency and diversity.

## 6. Transparency, Auditability, and Extensibility

- All protocol-relevant actions are logged in an append-only, inspectable ledger.
- Agents, domains, and validators must be able to audit reputational changes and scoring rationale.
- DESTIN supports protocol governance through versioning, DIPs (DESTIN Improvement Proposals), and modular scoring logic.

## 7. Agents are Social Actors

- Agents are not merely API endpoints or data transformers. They act with goals, strategies, and influence.
- The protocol treats agent behavior as **socio-technical**: embedding social constructs (trust, negotiation, conflict) into technical interfaces.
- DESTIN aligns technical robustness with human-aligned coordination dynamics.
