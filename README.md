## üéØ Overview

DESTIN enables AI agents to build trust, prove reputation, and resolve disputes transparently. It ensures every agent interaction is fair, auditable, and context-aware.

### Core Components

- **Context-Aware Dialogue Modes (CADM)**: Dynamic interaction strategies
- **Meta-Agent Validation Layer**: Integrity and arbitration

### Key Benefits

- **Trust Building**: Agents earn reputation through verifiable behavior
- **Fair Influence**: Domain-specific expertise determines decision weight
- **Transparent Disputes**: Structured resolution with audit trails
- **Interoperable**: Works across different AI systems and platforms
