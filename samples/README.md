# DESTIN Protocol ‚Äì Samples

This folder contains realistic example JSON files demonstrating how the DESTIN Protocol structures agent identity, reputation, domain scoring logic, audit logging, and interoperability artifacts.

These samples are **informative**, not normative, and intended to help implementers, validators, and tool builders understand how to model and exchange DESTIN-compatible data.

## üìå Notes

- Each sample file reflects the latest `v0.1` draft structure.
- Domain profiles are referenced via `domain_tags` in the agent definition.
- Audit logs are linked by `agent_id` and indexed by time.
- Interoperability bundles are designed for transport and verification outside the originating system.
- Anti-manipulation policies are enforced by validators and apply globally.

For detailed field descriptions, see the [DESTIN Specification](../spec/destin-v0.1.md).
